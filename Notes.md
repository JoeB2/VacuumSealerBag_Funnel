FreeCad project to make 3D printable Vacuum Bag Funnels.

Adding non-dry contents to Vacuum Seal Bags leaves residue to the hot melt section of the bag adding risk to seal failure.
This project will produce 

Funnel has tapered bottom edge to help reduce smearing on the bag while extracting the funnel

Using the Project Spreadsheet
1.)  Set the target Vacuum Bag's inside width in millimeters.
2.)  Set the desired funnel in the bag width.

Optionally: change the thickness annd the tapered section's height.

The Bag size in inches is calculated and applied to the label.
The inside the bag length of the funnel is calculated minimizing bag to funnel clearance.

Please NOTE: When changing values considerable recalculation time is required (1+ minutes on my machine - 20 cores 5.1GHz)

Optional: If you R-Click on the Top-most "Application Name" in the project model tree
and choose "Skip Recomputes" before making changes to the spreadsheet values: Bag width and Funnel Width
And then return to 3D View of the funnel; uncheck "Skip Recomputes" and press F5 the opportunity to skip
incidental recompute times and an opportunity to watch the funnel morph can be had!

Optional better Quality 3D print:
  1.) Open the Mesh Design Workbench
  2.) Choose The Funnel Body and make visible - with the space bar
  3.) Click on the toolbar "Tessellate shape" / "NetGen" / "Fineness" - VeryFine
  4.) File / Export

I hope you find these funnels as useful as I did!
